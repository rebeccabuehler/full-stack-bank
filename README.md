# full-stack-bank
I will be refactoring my bad-bank app into a three tier full stack program. Adding a back-end and authentication.

# Project Title: 
* Full Stack Bank App

# Description/Motivation: 
Originally the project was a bad bank app where it had a simple front end where you could create an account, login, deposit and withdraw money, and check your balance. I am refactoring this app to be a good bank in order to do that I have added a back end with a database and API. I will also be using firebase to implement authorization and authentication for the users and the tools provided in the bank app. This will improve the app to where a database of users exists and makes it more functional. By adding authentication and authorization it will add security to the app making it more realistic and usable in the future.

# Installation Guidelines: 
* Start by cloning the project from GitHub. 
* Then running npm install to make sure your computer and system has all the dependencies. 
* Next open your docker desktop, then run this command on your terminal (docker run -p 27017:27017 --name whateverName -d mongo). 
* After that you can open Robo 3T to see the database if you choose and simply connect to localhost:27017. 
* Finally run node index.js in your terminal and go to your browser and enter localhost:3000 and the program should run.
